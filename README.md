## Code First Girls CSS demo

This is just a little example HTML file for you to try to style. Put your code in `style.css`. If you want to see an example of the kind of stuff you can do, check out `example.css` - feel free to try linking it instead of `style.css`

### Resources to use while you're working on your style

#### General references

- [SitePoint CSS Reference](http://reference.sitepoint.com/css) and [MDN CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference). The former is useful as it groups available properties by type, whereas MDN's reference is much more comprehensive but less usefully organised.
- [OverAPI.com CSS Cheat Sheet](http://overapi.com/css/)

#### Concept-specific guides and tutorials

##### General layout

Useful and relatively short:

- [All About Floats](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/): basic guide to float
- [Detailed guide to positioning](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/positioning-content/): this explains `position` and `float` more thoroughly and gives a really good example of a columnar layout
- [Creating a CSS Layout from Scratch](http://www.subcide.com/articles/creating-a-css-layout-from-scratch/) - slightly outdated but still quite helpful
- [The Anti-hero of CSS Layout - "display:table"](http://colintoh.com/blog/display-table-anti-hero) - another way to do columnar layouts (still fraught with a few issues) is `display:table` - this is a good description of some ways you can use it

If you have more time / for later:

- [Flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - a comprehensive guide to Flexbox, a really cool new way of laying stuff out that makes things 10x easier than floats or tables
